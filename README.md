# Sage: Open Source Mathematical Software
## Spring 2014 at the University of Washington


This is a course about [SageMath](http://sagemath.org), which is a software development project with the following mission:

<h4 style="text-align:center">
  Create a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.
</h4>

I started Sage ten years ago, and many hundreds of people have contributed since.

- Understand how Sage is constructed and how to change Sage
- Do a nontrivial project involving Sage
- Understand how to work with abstract mathematical objects in Sage (e.g., a "linear transformation", a group, ring or field, etc.)

# Your Responsibilities

- *Homework:* (40% of grade) You will submit a homework assignment every week.  *No late homework will be accepted*, and no low grades are dropped.
- *Peer Grading:* (20% of grade) You will have to grade (on time) a lot of other students' homework in this class, and projects.  Peer grading will *not* be anonymous.
- *Project*: (40% of grade) You will create a project, which will be (peer) graded in May and June.
- *Presentation:* You will give a few minutes presentation about your project at the end of the course.
- *Attendance:* You are expected to come to class.
- *Grades:*  They will be at least as good as indicated by the following grading scale (I will likely curve it down): [(98, 4), (96.5, 3.9), (95, 3.8), (93.5, 3.7), (92, 3.6), (90.5, 3.5), (89, 3.4), (87.5, 3.3), (86, 3.2), (84.5, 3.1), (83, 3.0), (81.5, 2.9), (80, 2.8), (78.5, 2.7), (77, 2.6), (75.5, 2.5), (74, 2.4), (72.5, 2.3), (71, 2.2), (69.5, 2.1), (68, 2.0), (66.5, 1.9), (65, 1.8), (63.5, 1.7), (62, 1.6), (60.5, 1.5), (59, 1.4), (57.5, 1.3), (56, 1.2), (54.5, 1.1), (53.0, 1.0), (51.5, 0.9), (50.1, 0.8), (50.0,0.7), (0, 0)]

# Assignment Schedule

Homework and peer grading of homework is due every Friday by 6pm, and homework will be assigned on Friday, so you have 1 week to do each assignment.  The last week of classes will consist of project presentations.    There are no in-class midterms or final exams.
