    My project deals with an addition to the backend of sage, particularly a powerful new caching mechanism called SQLCache. When implemented into sage, it will go into the cache_func.pyx file in sage/misc/dist. My beamer presentation has a good intro into this funcitonality, which I intend to use with my project. After that I will go into sage for some examples. I believe this will easily take up 5 minutes.
