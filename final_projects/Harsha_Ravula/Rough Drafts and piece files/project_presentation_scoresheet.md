# MATH480 PRESENTATION SCORESHEET

WRITE YOUR NAME HERE: __________________________

## Grading Guidelines
Grade each presentation out of **6 points total**. Evaluate the presentation on the following three components; grade each component out of 2 points:

* R = Relevance to mathematical programming and technical complexity. Does the project demonstrate the use of nontrivial mathematical programming to solve some problem?

* P = Polish. Was the project professionally presented? Did the presenters speak clearly? Were there typos in the slides? Did the presented code work as intended?

* I = Interestingness and usefulness. Do you think the project content as presented is interesting and useful in some way?

For a given component, award 2 points if you think the project fully or almost fully attained the goal of that criterion. Award 1 point if you think the project was only partially successful in that regards, and award 0 points only if you think the project almost completely failed to successfully achieve the component's goal.

**When the presentation is done, place the score out of 2 for each component in the respective column next to the name of the presenter(s)**. You don't need to leave any comments. Remember the idea is to provide as objective as possible peer evaluation of the project presentations; please attempt to be fair in your scoring.
