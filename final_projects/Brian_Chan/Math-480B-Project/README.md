Course Scheduler
=======================

<p>This is my final project for Math 480B: Sage Open Source Mathematical Software Spring 2014.</p>

<p>The Course Scheduler program represents a basic university course scheduling program.</p>

<p>
This program allows a user to add, delete and view their courses using a graphical user interface in Java. A user can add a course to their schedule by clicking "Add" and entering in their course information (course name, credits, days the class is in session, start time and duration). The user can click a given cell and press "Drop" to drop the course from their schedule.
</p>

<p>
The 'src' folder includes some small programs that test the functionality of the classes (like Weekday, Time, Course and Schedule).
</p>

<p>
To start the graphical user interface, run 'SchedulerMain.java'.
