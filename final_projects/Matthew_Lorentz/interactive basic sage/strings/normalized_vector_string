Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To calculate a normalized vector in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> v.normalized() <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> sqrt(14)</font color> <br>
Where ‘v’ is the vector you have previously defined (see 'How do I enter a vector in sage' above). <br>
