Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To calculate the determinate in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> A.determinant() <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>"a constant"</font color> <br>
Where 'A' is the matrix you have previously defined (see 'How do I enter a matrix in sage' above)<br>
