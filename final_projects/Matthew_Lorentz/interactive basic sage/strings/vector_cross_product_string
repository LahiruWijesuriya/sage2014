Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To compute the cross product of two vectors in sage, we type;<br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> u.cross_product(v) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> (-43, 13, 1) </font color> <br>
Where ‘u and v’ are the vectors you have previously defined (see 'How do I enter a vector in sage' above).<br>
