Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To plot a 3D vector in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> P = arrow3d((0, 0, 0), v) <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> show(P) <br>
Where ‘v’ is the vector you have previously defined (see 'How do I enter a vector in sage' above) and (0, 0,0) is the position vector. <br>
To put it another way<br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> P = arrow3d(comma separated tuple of starting point, comma separated tuple of end point) <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> show(P)<br>
