Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To solve an equation in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> x = var(‘x’) <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> solve(x^2 + 2 == 6, x) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> [x == 4] </font color> <br>
To put it another way<br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> solve(‘Our equation’, ‘The variable we are solving for’) <br>
Notice that we first declare our variable “x = var(‘x’)” then when we enter our equation we use the double equals, i.e. “==“. <br>
