Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> 'The result that is returned by sage' </font color> <br>
<br>
Once we have defined our matices and/or a matrix and vector in sage (see above), We type <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> A.solve_right(v) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> [1] <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0] <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0] </font color> <br>
Or simply <br>
<font color = 'green'> sage: </font color> A \ v <br>
Where A is the left matrix and v is the right matrix or a vector. Note that the number of columns of the right matrix must be equal to the number of rows of the left matrix or the dimension of the vector. <br>
