Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To solve a system of equations in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> x, y, z = var('x, y, z') <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> solve([x - y - z == 0, x - y + z == 22, x + y + z == 10], x ,y, z) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> [[x == 5, y == -6, z == 11]] </font color> <br>
To put it another way<br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> solve([‘A comma separated list or our equations’], ‘The variables we are solving for’) <br>
Notice that we first declare our variables “x, y, z = var('x, y, z')”. Then when we enter our equation we use the double equals, i.e. “==“; and our equations are enclosed by square brackets. <br>
