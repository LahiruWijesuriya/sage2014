Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage' </font color> <br>
<br>
We type <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> A.rref() <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> [1 0 -1] <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0 1 2] <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0 0 0] </font color> <br>
Where 'A' is the matrix you have previously defined (see 'How do I enter a matrix in sage' above) <br>
