Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> 'The result that is returned by sage' </font color> <br>
<br>
Let's say that we want to differentiate $x*sin(x^2)$. We type, <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> diff(x*sin(x^2), x) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> 2*x^2*cos(x^2) + sin(x^2) </font color> <br>
To put it another way: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> diff('The function we want to differentiate', 'The variable we are differentiating with respect to') <br>
