Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To add vectors in sage we simply add them.<br>
Say we have previously defined vectors v and u (see 'How do I enter a vector in sage' above), we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> v + u <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'> (2, 4, 6) </font color> <br>
