Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> <font color = 'blue'>'The result that is returned by sage'</font color> <br>
<br>
To plot a function in sage, we type; <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> plot(x^2, (x, -1, 1)) <br>
To put it another way, <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> plot(‘Our function’, (x, xMin, xMax)) <br>
