<h1 id="what-is-my-project">What is my project?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>I wrote up documentation for the API that is contained in SageMathCloud</li>
  <li>I wanted ability to use Sage to do Math in my programming without having to install Sage locally. </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Ability to interact with SageMathCloud for any device programmatically. </li>
  <li>Allow any internet connected device to do Math using Sage.  </li>
  <li>Unlock SageMathCloud to third parties.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-is-an-api">What is an API?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>An API or <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> allows a product or service to talk to other products and services</li>
  <li>Opens up data and functionality to others (eg: third party developers, companies, users, toasters, etc)</li>
  <li>Exchange data internally and externally (separates the logic from the application)</li>
  <li>Leverage cloud resources, because more and more devices are becoming mobile and the need for the processing to be done in the cloud is increasing. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-have-an-api">Why have an API?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Leverage the same logic for all of your applications (eg: web, mobile, etc)</li>
  <li>Partnerships with third parties. </li>
  <li>Data exchange</li>
  <li>Monetization</li>
  <li>Presence/Awareness driving people to SageMathCloud</li>
  <li>“SageMathCloud is a way to get Sage onto Windows Laptops” but the API for SageMathCloud is a way to get Sage onto every device!</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-i-built">What I built</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight documentation to display all possible actions that can be taken by third parties in SageMathCloud. </li>
  <li>Easy to extend using <strong>Markdown</strong></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Trudeaucj/SMCAPI">GitHub Page</a> page to explain installation as well as how to add to the documentation</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="where-to-go-next">Where to go next?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Implement Authentication</li>
  <li>Client Library</li>
  <li>Spread the word of SageMathCloud APIs</li>
  <li>If you have any ideas of useful APIs for SageMathCloud please reach out to me and let me know! </li>
</ul>
